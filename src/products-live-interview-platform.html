				Remote Hiring and Video interviewing gives you the benefit of gauging the person’s reaction to questions and lets you observe their body
				language. Moreover, with the help of a suitable and modern Digital Interviewing platform like ours, you can even show images, presentations,
				or videos as a problem to solve to the applicant.

			<section class="prod-para m-b-16">
				Face to face interviews are costly from time spent by both parties as well reimbursement of expenses in case of candidates visiting from
				distance. Video Interviewing is a no-brainer alternative here - effective and inexpensive! Additionally, Video Interviews can also help in
				record keeping and being more data driven when it comes to candidate’s selection. Turnaround time also improves significantly, given that
				arranging for Video Interviews is much more straightforward than in-person interviews. And in the post-pandemic world, it is safer too!
